createcommandinsert.zip -> A swing in java screen that lets you enter the Score information from the final assessment exams (AV1-AV2, AV2-AV3 and AV1-AV3) and dynamically generate insert commands to run in the Brain_Academy database. This was done because some errors were found in the inclusion of the data of the Scores in the spreadsheets and it was necessary to correct directly the inclusion of this data in the created screen.

createcommandupdatecogstate.zip -> java class to dynamically generate sql insert commands from the cogstate exam and thus run in the Brain_Academy database.
